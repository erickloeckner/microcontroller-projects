# Microcontroller Projects

A collection of my projects for Arm-based microcontrollers using Rust. The standard toolchain can be downloaded here:
https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started

The projects can be compiled into UF2 format and copied to boards via file manager or CLI when they are in bootloader mode.

Board-specific directions are in the relevant directory, such as rp-pico for the Raspberry Pi Pico.
